# Interactive Snow Globe 🎄

## Description
This interactive snow globe is a holiday-themed React/Next.js project built to showcase front-end development skills. Users can:

- Move their cursor over the globe to create parallax effects  
- Shake the globe to trigger a snowstorm burst  
- Adjust the intensity of falling snow  

The project combines **CSS animations, canvas-based snow**, and **image layering** to create a visually engaging, interactive experience. It’s perfect as a **portfolio piece** or a **seasonal social media showcase**.

## Technologies Used
- **React 18** – for building interactive UI components  
- **Next.js 14** – server-side rendering, routing, and image optimization  
- **TypeScript** – for type safety and maintainable code  
- **CSS / Tailwind CSS** – styling, gradients, and animations  
- **Canvas API** – for creating smooth, continuous snow animations  
- **Next.js Image component** – optimized image handling for responsive layout

## Features
- **Interactive Parallax**: The globe subtly moves as users move the cursor.  
- **Shake Animation**: Clicking the “Shake” button triggers a playful snowstorm animation.  
- **Snow Intensity Shake**: Users can control the amount of falling snow.  
- **Customizable Image**: Add your own holiday-themed or personal images to the globe.  
- **Responsive Design**: Works on multiple screen sizes while maintaining aspect ratio.

## What I Learned
- How to **layer multiple interactive elements** (image + canvas + CSS animations) in a React/Next.js project.  
- Using the **Canvas API** for smooth, animated snow particles.  
- Implementing **parallax effects** with mouse movement in a React component.  
- How to **use Next.js Image** component with `object-fit` and `object-position` for proper image scaling and alignment inside a circular container.  
- Integrating **dynamic state** (snow intensity, shake animation) into a visually rich component.
